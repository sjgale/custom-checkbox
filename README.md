Custom Checkbox

## Description
Sometimes the default checkboxes provided by the browser just don't work for your design. Add the custom-checkbox script to your page to replace the default checkbox with a custom one made up of DIV elements you can style any way you want. A hidden input with the same name and values, and custom callback can optionally be added so that no functionality is lost from the page, just a cleaner design.

Default styles have been added. I would recommed either forking this repo and updating the styles to make them your own or overwriting the styles provided in you own stylesheet by adding some styles with greater specificity.
